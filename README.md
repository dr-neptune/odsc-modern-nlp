# ODSC Workshop: "Modern NLP: Pre-training, Fine-tuning, Prompt Engineering, and Human Feedback"

(These are the materials for the "Modern NLP: Pre-training, Fine-tuning, Prompt Engineering, and Human Feedback" workshop at ODSC East 2023.)

Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) is not about creating big datasets and training models from scratch. The most innovative applications of NLP these days leverage large pre-trained, foundation models along with fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and/or human feedback. Leaving this workshop, you will understand each of these topics, and you will have gained the practical, hands-on expertise to start integrating modern NLP in your domain. 

## Setup and pre-requisites:

- Create a free Prediction Guard account and get an access token as described [here](https://docs.predictionguard.com/).
- Create a free SerpAPI account and get an API key as described [here](https://serpapi.com/)
- Make sure you either:
    - have access to a Google account, such that you can use the below notebooks via Google Colab
    - have a local Python environment with Jupyter available (to download notebooks from here and use them locally

## Workshop materials

Slides from the workshop are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OKfd_f9H_51ITCs92vv6p-r_Z4dONao6CuQPA-2fkH8/edit?usp=sharing). All of the code examples are in the form of Python notebooks. The notebooks can be run by following the links below then making a copy of the notebook in your Google account. Alternatively, the notebooks can be downloaded from this repository to be run locally with Jupyter.
